Presigned URLs for secure uploads and downloads (time-limited).

Central CDN integration with cache invalidation endpoint.

Design & Theme

Theme variables: primary/secondary colors, font families, spacing scale.

Font manager: integrate Google Fonts + upload custom fonts (woff2).

Global CSS variables and per-page overrides.

Dark mode preview.

Admin Ops & Integrations

Role-based access & granular permissions.

Audit logs, content version history, restore to previous version.

Scheduled publishing & unpublish.

Rate-limited bulk operations & queuing (Redis/Queue workers).

Integrations: Mail (SMTP/SendGrid), SMS (Twilio), Payment (Stripe/PayPal), Analytics.

DevOps & Observability

Health checks, metrics (Prometheus/Grafana), error reporting (Sentry).

DB backups, point-in-time recovery, read-replicas for scaling.

4) Security & hardening (what to implement and why)
Authentication & Session

Strong password hashing: Argon2id (or Bcrypt with secure parameters).

Enforce MFA (TOTP) for all admin roles and allow U2F/YubiKey for super-admins.

Short-lived session cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict.

JWT access tokens with short TTL + refresh tokens stored server-side or secure httpOnly cookie.

Limit concurrent sessions & expose admin session management (revoke sessions).

Network & app perimeter

Force HTTPS everywhere (Let's Encrypt or managed TLS). HSTS header.

Admin behind IP allowlist option and/or enforce VPN access for super-admins.

Obscure admin route (e.g., not /admin, configurable path); do NOT rely on obscurity alone.

Web Application Firewall (Cloudflare/WAF/mod_security) and rate limiting.

Web & API hardening

CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.

Strict CSP (Content Security Policy) and X-Frame-Options: DENY.

Input validation & parameterized queries (no string concatenation).

ORM prepared-statements; avoid dynamic SQL where possible.

Output encoding to mitigate XSS; sanitize HTML on WYSIWYG content using a allowlist sanitizer.

File validation for uploads (mime sniffing, virus scan integration).

URLs & assets encryption

Use signed (presigned) URLs for media downloads and uploads (S3 presigned or CDN signed URLs). They expire and include a signature — cannot be guessed.

For admin one-time links (passwordless login, password reset), use cryptographically signed one-time tokens with short expiry; store a server-side nonce to prevent replay.

Data at rest & keys

Encrypt sensitive DB columns (e.g., passport numbers) with AES-256 using KMS or managed secrets.

Use a secret store (HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS) for keys; rotate keys regularly.

Backups encrypted and stored offsite with access controls.

Monitoring & detection

Audit logs with immutability (append-only) and periodic export to SIEM.

File integrity monitoring for critical files.

IDS/IPS for suspicious traffic and automated alerts.

Scheduled pentesting and vulnerability scanning (Snyk, Dependabot).

Deployment security

CI pipelines run static analysis, dependency checks, secrets-scan before deployment.

Limit who can deploy to production; require approvals for prod deploys.

Honest note: “bug-free” is impossible to guarantee. Instead aim for strong SDLC, automated tests, pen-testing, and a bug-fix SLA.

5) DB schema (core tables, simplified)
scss
Copy
Edit
users (id, name, email, password_hash, phone, role_id, is_active, mfa_secret, created_at, last_login)
roles (id, name)
permissions (id, name, description)
role_permission (role_id, permission_id)

pages (id, slug, title, body, meta_title, meta_desc, status, author_id, version, created_at, updated_at, published_at)

jobs (id, title, company, country, city, job_type, salary_min, salary_max, description, requirements, benefits, contact_email, status, featured, views, created_by, created_at, updated_at)

applications (id, job_id, candidate_name, candidate_email, resume_path, cover_letter, status, notes, applied_at)

events (id, title, description, venue, start_at, end_at, capacity, ticket_price, created_by, created_at)

media (id, filename, mime_type, size, width, height, path, storage_backend, uploaded_by, tags, created_at)

settings (key, value_json, updated_by, updated_at)

audit_logs (id, user_id, action, model, model_id, changes_json, ip, user_agent, created_at)
(Use UUID primary keys if you want non-guessable IDs for security.)

6) Core API endpoints (examples)

POST /api/admin/login

POST /api/admin/logout

POST /api/admin/2fa/verify

POST /api/admin/password-reset/request

POST /api/admin/password-reset/confirm

Pages:

POST /api/admin/users/:id/revoke-sessions

Settings:

GET /api/admin/settings

PUT /api/admin/settings

Audit:

GET /api/admin/audit (filterable)

7) UI/UX & Admin Panel details
Default dashboard widgets: site visits, active jobs, applicants today, upcoming events, error rate.

Inline editing on page list (quick edit).

Bulk actions: publish/unpublish/delete/feature.

Role-aware UI: show/hide buttons based on permission.

Per-item activity feed (who edited what and when).

Undo / restore last N changes per page/version diff viewer.

Drag-and-drop media insertion in the editor + automatic alt text suggestions (AI-assisted optional).

Accessibility checks for content (WCAG automated audit).

8) Image / media & "encrypted URL" approach (practical)
Store originals in S3 (or MinIO). Serve via CDN (CloudFront, Cloudflare).

Generate signed CDN URLs for private assets (signed cookie or signed URL). Example:

Create presigned URL server-side that expires in X minutes, deliver to client only after admin auth verification.

For public site images (jobs/company logos) you can use public CDN cached resources. For sensitive docs (resumes), always store encrypted and serve with signed presigned links.

For image processing (crop/resize) use server-side worker or on-the-fly image resizer service with signed requests and SHA256 signature to prevent abuse.

9) Testing & CI/CD
Unit tests for controllers and services.

Integration tests for DB interactions and upload flows.

E2E tests for flows: login+2FA, create job, apply candidate, upload resume.

Security tests: dependency vulnerability scan, SAST, DAST.

CI: run tests and linters on PR; require review before merge.

CD: Blue/green deploy to minimize downtime.

10) Monitoring, backup & incident response
Use Sentry for errors; PagerDuty for critical alerts.

Backup DB daily and keep weekly monthly snapshots with retention policy.

Run routine recovery drills (restore from backup in staging).

Keep an incident playbook: steps to rotate keys, revoke sessions, disable admin access.

11) Choice of stack (recommended given your background)
If you prefer PHP/Laravel (you said you used Laravel before) — Laravel + Livewire for a fast admin UI, with:

Frontend: Blade + Livewire (or React/Next for richer UI)

DB: Postgres (or MySQL) + Redis

Storage: AWS S3 / MinIO

Search: ElasticSearch or MeiliSearch (for jobs)

Queue: Redis + Horizon

Authentication: Laravel Sanctum (for SPA) + TOTP package

ORM: Eloquent with prepared statements (safe)

If you want JS stack: NestJS (backend) + Next.js (Admin) + TypeORM + Postgres.

12) Minimal roadmap / milestones
MVP (2–3 weeks): Auth, Jobs CRUD, Pages CRUD, Media uploads (S3), Dashboard, RBAC.

Phase 2 (2–4 weeks): Events, Applications, Consultation bookings, scheduled publishing, theme editor.

Phase 3 (2–3 weeks): Advanced security, image optimization, presigned URLs, monitoring & backups, tests.

Phase 4 (ongoing): Pen testing, performance tuning, multilingual, analytics dashboards, integrations.

13) Example "secure presigned URL" pattern (concept)
Admin requests POST /api/admin/media/presign-upload with filename & content-type.

Server validates admin permission and returns { url: "<S3 presigned upload URL>", id: "<media-id>", preview: "<signed CDN url>" }.

Client uploads directly to S3 with the presigned URL.

After success, client calls POST /api/admin/media/complete to mark file as ready. Server validates signature & creates DB record.

For downloads of CVs: generate presigned GET url that expires in e.g. 10 minutes.

14) Final notes & next steps I suggest
Choose stack (Laravel recommended since you're familiar). I can produce a starter repo structure and sample controller + migration if you want.

Decide hosting (VPS vs cloud managed). For scale and security, go cloud (AWS/GCP/Hetzner + Cloudflare).

Prioritize: 2FA + presigned uploads + audit logs + backups — these should be in MVP for production security.
