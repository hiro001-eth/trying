Nice — this is a great brief. Below I’ll give you:

1. A **developer-ready prompt** you can paste into ChatGPT or give to a developer/agency.
2. A **complete high-level MVC architecture** for the Admin Panel tailored to your Udaan Agencies website (jobs, events, pages, contact, consultations).
3. **Feature list** (content, media, UX, integrations, ops) and **security & hardening** measures (what to do and why).
4. **Database schema essentials**, core API/Controller routes (CRUD), and recommended tech stack.
5. **Testing, deployment & maintenance** checklist.

I keep it practical and actionable — you can copy-paste the prompt (below) and also send the architecture to your devs.

# 1) Developer prompt (copy-paste)

```
BUILD AN ENTERPRISE-GRADE ADMIN PANEL (MVC) FOR "Udaan Agencies" WEBSITE

Project summary:
Create a secure, extensible Admin Panel to fully manage the public site (Home, Jobs, About, Events, Consultation booking, Contact, Success stories, Policies, Footer, etc.). Admins must be able to CRUD content, manage themes, fonts, images, job postings and applicants, events, consultations, users, partners, and global site settings. It must support multi-role RBAC, full audit trail, content versioning, scheduled publishing, and safe signed/encrypted admin URLs. Integrate media CDN, email, SMS, and payment gateway hooks. Provide RESTful API + server-rendered Admin UI with live preview and WYSIWYG editing. Use secure defaults, automated tests, CI/CD, backups, and monitoring.

Core requirements:
- MVC architecture; controllers for Jobs, Events, Pages, Media, Users, Settings, Reports, Auth, Audit.
- Role-based access control: super-admin, content-admin, moderator, HR (job manager), event-manager, support.
- WYSIWYG editor with image upload & inline formatting, markdown support, and template blocks.
- Global Theme & Font manager: live preview, color palette, CSS variables, font upload & Google Fonts integration.
- Media manager: image optimization, responsive versions, cropping, tagging, CDN storage (S3/MinIO), presigned URLs for secure access.
- Job management: multi-country, job types, salary ranges, featured flag, application count, quick apply, bulk import/export CSV.
- Event management: registration limits, ticketing metadata, RSVPs, calendar export (ics).
- Consultation bookings: calendar integration, admin scheduling, reminders via email/SMS.
- Applicants & contact management: secure file storage for CVs, application status lifecycle, notes, and internal comments.
- System settings: site contact info, working hours, phone/email, business address, policies; editable via Admin.
- Audit & activity log; content versioning and rollback; scheduled publishing.
- API auth with JWT + refresh tokens, CSRF protection for the admin UI.
- Secure admin endpoints: obscured and configurable admin path, IP allowlist, rate limiting, 2FA, MFA (TOTP), single sign-on support.
- Encrypted and signed URLs: presigned object URLs for media and signed tokenized admin links for one-time actions.
- HTTPS/TLS, HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security headers.
- Automated backup, DB encryption-at-rest, key management & rotation.
- Tests: unit, integration, e2e (Cypress/Puppeteer), static code analysis & automated security scanning.
- CI/CD with staging & production; migration plan and data seeding for dev.

Deliverables:
1. Repo with clear README, docker-compose + Dockerfile, and env sample.
2. Full MVC code base for backend + Admin UI; Postgres schema migrations.
3. API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger) and Admin UI design (Figma/Storybook optional).
4. Tests, CI pipeline config, deployment scripts, and runbook for backups and incident response.
5. Security report & checklist, plus a 1-week hardening & pentest remediation plan.

Preferred stack: Laravel (or Node NestJS/Django) backend; React/Next admin with Tailwind & shadcn components; Postgres DB; Redis for caching & sessions; S3 + CDN; Nginx reverse proxy; Docker.

---

# 4) Security & hardening (what to implement and why)

**Authentication & Session**

* Strong password hashing: Argon2id (or Bcrypt with secure parameters).
* Enforce MFA (TOTP) for all admin roles and allow U2F/YubiKey for super-admins.
* Short-lived session cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`.
* JWT access tokens with short TTL + refresh tokens stored server-side or secure httpOnly cookie.
* Limit concurrent sessions & expose admin session management (revoke sessions).

**Network & app perimeter**

* Force HTTPS everywhere (Let's Encrypt or managed TLS). HSTS header.
* Admin behind IP allowlist option and/or enforce VPN access for super-admins.
* Obscure admin route (e.g., not `/admin`, configurable path); do NOT rely on obscurity alone.
* Web Application Firewall (Cloudflare/WAF/mod\_security) and rate limiting.

**Web & API hardening**

* CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.
* Strict CSP (Content Security Policy) and X-Frame-Options: DENY.
* Input validation & parameterized queries (no string concatenation).
* ORM prepared-statements; avoid dynamic SQL where possible.
* Output encoding to mitigate XSS; sanitize HTML on WYSIWYG content using a allowlist sanitizer.
* File validation for uploads (mime sniffing, virus scan integration).

**URLs & assets encryption**

* Use **signed (presigned) URLs** for media downloads and uploads (S3 presigned or CDN signed URLs). They expire and include a signature — cannot be guessed.
* For admin one-time links (passwordless login, password reset), use cryptographically signed one-time tokens with short expiry; store a server-side nonce to prevent replay.

**Data at rest & keys**

* Encrypt sensitive DB columns (e.g., passport numbers) with AES-256 using KMS or managed secrets.
* Use a secret store (HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS) for keys; rotate keys regularly.
* Backups encrypted and stored offsite with access controls.

**Monitoring & detection**

* Audit logs with immutability (append-only) and periodic export to SIEM.
* File integrity monitoring for critical files.
* IDS/IPS for suspicious traffic and automated alerts.
* Scheduled pentesting and vulnerability scanning (Snyk, Dependabot).

**Deployment security**

* CI pipelines run static analysis, dependency checks, secrets-scan before deployment.
* Limit who can deploy to production; require approvals for prod deploys.

**Honest note:** “bug-free” is impossible to guarantee. Instead aim for strong SDLC, automated tests, pen-testing, and a bug-fix SLA.

# 5) DB schema (core tables, simplified)

```
users (id, name, email, password_hash, phone, role_id, is_active, mfa_secret, created_at, last_login)
roles (id, name)
permissions (id, name, description)
role_permission (role_id, permission_id)

pages (id, slug, title, body, meta_title, meta_desc, status, author_id, version, created_at, updated_at, published_at)

jobs (id, title, company, country, city, job_type, salary_min, salary_max, description, requirements, benefits, contact_email, status, featured, views, created_by, created_at, updated_at)

applications (id, job_id, candidate_name, candidate_email, resume_path, cover_letter, status, notes, applied_at)

events (id, title, description, venue, start_at, end_at, capacity, ticket_price, created_by, created_at)

media (id, filename, mime_type, size, width, height, path, storage_backend, uploaded_by, tags, created_at)

settings (key, value_json, updated_by, updated_at)

audit_logs (id, user_id, action, model, model_id, changes_json, ip, user_agent, created_at)
```

(Use UUID primary keys if you want non-guessable IDs for security.)

# 6) Core API endpoints (examples)

Auth:

* `POST /api/admin/login`
* `POST /api/admin/logout`
* `POST /api/admin/2fa/verify`
* `POST /api/admin/password-reset/request`
* `POST /api/admin/password-reset/confirm`

Pages:

* `GET /api/admin/pages`
* `POST /api/admin/pages`
* `GET /api/admin/pages/:id/preview`
* `PUT /api/admin/pages/:id`
* `DELETE /api/admin/pages/:id`
* `POST /api/admin/pages/:id/publish` (schedule/publish)

* `GET /api/admin/jobs`
* `POST /api/admin/jobs`
* `PUT /api/admin/jobs/:id`
* `DELETE /api/admin/jobs/:id`
* `POST /api/admin/jobs/bulk-import` (CSV)
* `GET /api/admin/jobs/:id/applications`

* `PUT /api/admin/settings`

Audit:

* `GET /api/admin/audit` (filterable)

---

# 7) UI/UX & Admin Panel details

* Default dashboard widgets: site visits, active jobs, applicants today, upcoming events, error rate.
* Inline editing on page list (quick edit).
* Bulk actions: publish/unpublish/delete/feature.
* Role-aware UI: show/hide buttons based on permission.
* Per-item activity feed (who edited what and when).
* Undo / restore last N changes per page/version diff viewer.
* Drag-and-drop media insertion in the editor + automatic alt text suggestions (AI-assisted optional).
* Accessibility checks for content (WCAG automated audit).

---

# 8) Image / media & "encrypted URL" approach (practical)

* Store originals in S3 (or MinIO). Serve via CDN (CloudFront, Cloudflare).
* Generate **signed CDN URLs** for private assets (signed cookie or signed URL). Example:

  * Create presigned URL server-side that expires in X minutes, deliver to client only after admin auth verification.
* For public site images (jobs/company logos) you can use public CDN cached resources. For sensitive docs (resumes), always store encrypted and serve with signed presigned links.
* For image processing (crop/resize) use server-side worker or on-the-fly image resizer service with signed requests and SHA256 signature to prevent abuse.

---

# 9) Testing & CI/CD

* Unit tests for controllers and services.
* Integration tests for DB interactions and upload flows.
* E2E tests for flows: login+2FA, create job, apply candidate, upload resume.
* Security tests: dependency vulnerability scan, SAST, DAST.
* CI: run tests and linters on PR; require review before merge.
* CD: Blue/green deploy to minimize downtime.

---

# 10) Monitoring, backup & incident response

* Use Sentry for errors; PagerDuty for critical alerts.
* Backup DB daily and keep weekly monthly snapshots with retention policy.
* Run routine recovery drills (restore from backup in staging).
* Keep an incident playbook: steps to rotate keys, revoke sessions, disable admin access.

---

# 11) Choice of stack (recommended given your background)

If you prefer PHP/Laravel (you said you used Laravel before) — **Laravel + Livewire** for a fast admin UI, with:

* Frontend: Blade + Livewire (or React/Next for richer UI)
* DB: Postgres (or MySQL) + Redis
* Storage: AWS S3 / MinIO
* Search: ElasticSearch or MeiliSearch (for jobs)
* Queue: Redis + Horizon
* Authentication: Laravel Sanctum (for SPA) + TOTP package
* ORM: Eloquent with prepared statements (safe)

If you want JS stack: **NestJS (backend) + Next.js (Admin)** + TypeORM + Postgres.

---

# 12) Minimal roadmap / milestones

1. MVP (2–3 weeks): Auth, Jobs CRUD, Pages CRUD, Media uploads (S3), Dashboard, RBAC.
2. Phase 2 (2–4 weeks): Events, Applications, Consultation bookings, scheduled publishing, theme editor.
3. Phase 3 (2–3 weeks): Advanced security, image optimization, presigned URLs, monitoring & backups, tests.
4. Phase 4 (ongoing): Pen testing, performance tuning, multilingual, analytics dashboards, integrations.

---

# 13) Example "secure presigned URL" pattern (concept)

* Admin requests `POST /api/admin/media/presign-upload` with filename & content-type.
* Server validates admin permission and returns `{ url: "<S3 presigned upload URL>", id: "<media-id>", preview: "<signed CDN url>" }`.
* Client uploads directly to S3 with the presigned URL.
* After success, client calls `POST /api/admin/media/complete` to mark file as ready. Server validates signature & creates DB record.
* For downloads of CVs: generate presigned GET url that expires in e.g. 10 minutes.

---

# 14) Final notes & next steps I suggest

* Choose stack (Laravel recommended since you're familiar). I can produce a starter repo structure and sample controller + migration if you want.
* Decide hosting (VPS vs cloud managed). For scale and security, go cloud (AWS/GCP/Hetzner + Cloudflare).
* Prioritize: 2FA + presigned uploads + audit logs + backups — these should be in MVP for production security.

---

If you want, I can now:

* generate a **detailed Laravel project scaffolding** (folders, models, migrations, sample controllers + API routes) tailored to this spec, or
* produce a **React/Next admin UI mock** (single-file component + Tailwind + theme editor UI), or
* write the **DB migrations** and `JobsController` + `ApplicationsController` boilerplate code.

Which of those would you like next?
