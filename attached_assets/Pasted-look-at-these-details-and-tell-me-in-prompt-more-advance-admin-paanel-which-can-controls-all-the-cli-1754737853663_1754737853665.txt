ChatGPT said:

Thought for 5s
Nice — this is a great brief. Below I’ll give you:

A developer-ready prompt you can paste into ChatGPT or give to a developer/agency.

A complete high-level MVC architecture for the Admin Panel tailored to your Udaan Agencies website (jobs, events, pages, contact, consultations).

Feature list (content, media, UX, integrations, ops) and security & hardening measures (what to do and why).

Database schema essentials, core API/Controller routes (CRUD), and recommended tech stack.

Testing, deployment & maintenance checklist.

I keep it practical and actionable — you can copy-paste the prompt (below) and also send the architecture to your devs.

1) Developer prompt (copy-paste)

BUILD AN ENTERPRISE-GRADE ADMIN PANEL (MVC) FOR "Udaan Agencies" WEBSITE

Project summary:
Create a secure, extensible Admin Panel to fully manage the public site (Home, Jobs, About, Events, Consultation booking, Contact, Success stories, Policies, Footer, etc.). Admins must be able to CRUD content, manage themes, fonts, images, job postings and applicants, events, consultations, users, partners, and global site settings. It must support multi-role RBAC, full audit trail, content versioning, scheduled publishing, and safe signed/encrypted admin URLs. Integrate media CDN, email, SMS, and payment gateway hooks. Provide RESTful API + server-rendered Admin UI with live preview and WYSIWYG editing. Use secure defaults, automated tests, CI/CD, backups, and monitoring.

Core requirements:
- MVC architecture; controllers for Jobs, Events, Pages, Media, Users, Settings, Reports, Auth, Audit.
- Role-based access control: super-admin, content-admin, moderator, HR (job manager), event-manager, support.
- WYSIWYG editor with image upload & inline formatting, markdown support, and template blocks.
- Global Theme & Font manager: live preview, color palette, CSS variables, font upload & Google Fonts integration.
- Media manager: image optimization, responsive versions, cropping, tagging, CDN storage (S3/MinIO), presigned URLs for secure access.
- Job management: multi-country, job types, salary ranges, featured flag, application count, quick apply, bulk import/export CSV.
- Event management: registration limits, ticketing metadata, RSVPs, calendar export (ics).
- Consultation bookings: calendar integration, admin scheduling, reminders via email/SMS.
- Applicants & contact management: secure file storage for CVs, application status lifecycle, notes, and internal comments.
- System settings: site contact info, working hours, phone/email, business address, policies; editable via Admin.
- Audit & activity log; content versioning and rollback; scheduled publishing.
- API auth with JWT + refresh tokens, CSRF protection for the admin UI.
- Secure admin endpoints: obscured and configurable admin path, IP allowlist, rate limiting, 2FA, MFA (TOTP), single sign-on support.
- Encrypted and signed URLs: presigned object URLs for media and signed tokenized admin links for one-time actions.
- HTTPS/TLS, HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security headers.
- Automated backup, DB encryption-at-rest, key management & rotation.
- Tests: unit, integration, e2e (Cypress/Puppeteer), static code analysis & automated security scanning.
- CI/CD with staging & production; migration plan and data seeding for dev.

Deliverables:
1. Repo with clear README, docker-compose + Dockerfile, and env sample.
2. Full MVC code base for backend + Admin UI; Postgres schema migrations.
3. API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger) and Admin UI design (Figma/Storybook optional).
4. Tests, CI pipeline config, deployment scripts, and runbook for backups and incident response.
5. Security report & checklist, plus a 1-week hardening & pentest remediation plan.

Preferred stack: Laravel (or Node NestJS/Django) backend; React/Next admin with Tailwind & shadcn components; Postgres DB; Redis for caching & sessions; S3 + CDN; Nginx reverse proxy; Docker.

3) Feature list — admin capabilities (detailed)

Internationalization (Nepali + English), locale switch, currency configs.

Theme variables: primary/secondary colors, font families, spacing scale.

Font manager: integrate Google Fonts + upload custom fonts (woff2).

Global CSS variables and per-page overrides.

Admin Ops & Integrations

Role-based access & granular permissions.

Audit logs, content version history, restore to previous version.

Scheduled publishing & unpublish.

Rate-limited bulk operations & queuing (Redis/Queue workers).

Integrations: Mail (SMTP/SendGrid), SMS (Twilio), Payment (Stripe/PayPal), Analytics.

DevOps & Observability

Health checks, metrics (Prometheus/Grafana), error reporting (Sentry).

DB backups, point-in-time recovery, read-replicas for scaling.

4) Security & hardening (what to implement and why)
Authentication & Session

Strong password hashing: Argon2id (or Bcrypt with secure parameters).

Enforce MFA (TOTP) for all admin roles and allow U2F/YubiKey for super-admins.

Short-lived session cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict.

JWT access tokens with short TTL + refresh tokens stored server-side or secure httpOnly cookie.

Limit concurrent sessions & expose admin session management (revoke sessions).

Network & app perimeter

Force HTTPS everywhere (Let's Encrypt or managed TLS). HSTS header.

Admin behind IP allowlist option and/or enforce VPN access for super-admins.

Obscure admin route (e.g., not /admin, configurable path); do NOT rely on obscurity alone.

Web Application Firewall (Cloudflare/WAF/mod_security) and rate limiting.

Web & API hardening

CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.

Strict CSP (Content Security Policy) and X-Frame-Options: DENY.

Input validation & parameterized queries (no string concatenation).

ORM prepared-statements; avoid dynamic SQL where possible.

Output encoding to mitigate XSS; sanitize HTML on WYSIWYG content using a allowlist sanitizer.

File validation for uploads (mime sniffing, virus scan integration).

URLs & assets encryption

Use signed (presigned) URLs for media downloads and uploads (S3 presigned or CDN signed URLs). They expire and include a signature — cannot be guessed.

For admin one-time links (passwordless login, password reset), use cryptographically signed one-time tokens with short expiry; store a server-side nonce to prevent replay.

Data at rest & keys

Encrypt sensitive DB columns (e.g., passport numbers) with AES-256 using KMS or managed secrets.

Use a secret store (HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS) for keys; rotate keys regularly.

Backups encrypted and stored offsite with access controls.

Monitoring & detection

Audit logs with immutability (append-only) and periodic export to SIEM.

File integrity monitoring for critical files.

IDS/IPS for suspicious traffic and automated alerts.

Scheduled pentesting and vulnerability scanning (Snyk, Dependabot).

Deployment security

CI pipelines run static analysis, dependency checks, secrets-scan before deployment.

Limit who can deploy to production; require approvals for prod deploys.

Honest note: “bug-free” is impossible to guarantee. Instead aim for strong SDLC, automated tests, pen-testing, and a bug-fix SLA.

6) Core API endpoints (examples)
Auth:

POST /api/admin/login

POST /api/admin/logout

POST /api/admin/2fa/verify

POST /api/admin/password-reset/request

POST /api/admin/password-reset/confirm

Pages:

GET /api/admin/pages

POST /api/admin/pages

GET /api/admin/pages/:id/preview

PUT /api/admin/pages/:id

DELETE /api/admin/pages/:id

POST /api/admin/pages/:id/publish (schedule/publish)

Jobs:

GET /api/admin/jobs

POST /api/admin/jobs

PUT /api/admin/jobs/:id

DELETE /api/admin/jobs/:id

POST /api/admin/jobs/bulk-import (CSV)

GET /api/admin/jobs/:id/applications

Media:

POST /api/admin/media/presign-upload -> return presigned URL

GET /api/admin/media (list)

DELETE /api/admin/media/:id

Users & Roles:

GET /api/admin/users

POST /api/admin/users

PUT /api/admin/users/:id/roles

POST /api/admin/users/:id/revoke-sessions

Settings:

GET /api/admin/settings

PUT /api/admin/settings

Audit:

GET /api/admin/audit (filterable)

7) UI/UX & Admin Panel details
Default dashboard widgets: site visits, active jobs, applicants today, upcoming events, error rate.

Inline editing on page list (quick edit).

Bulk actions: publish/unpublish/delete/feature.

Role-aware UI: show/hide buttons based on permission.

Per-item activity feed (who edited what and when).

Undo / restore last N changes per page/version diff viewer.

Drag-and-drop media insertion in the editor + automatic alt text suggestions (AI-assisted optional).

Accessibility checks for content (WCAG automated audit).

8) Image / media & "encrypted URL" approach (practical)
Store originals in S3 (or MinIO). Serve via CDN (CloudFront, Cloudflare).

Generate signed CDN URLs for private assets (signed cookie or signed URL). Example:

Create presigned URL server-side that expires in X minutes, deliver to client only after admin auth verification.

For public site images (jobs/company logos) you can use public CDN cached resources. For sensitive docs (resumes), always store encrypted and serve with signed presigned links.

For image processing (crop/resize) use server-side worker or on-the-fly image resizer service with signed requests and SHA256 signature to prevent abuse.

9) Testing & CI/CD
Unit tests for controllers and services.

Integration tests for DB interactions and upload flows.

E2E tests for flows: login+2FA, create job, apply candidate, upload resume.

Security tests: dependency vulnerability scan, SAST, DAST.

CI: run tests and linters on PR; require review before merge.

CD: Blue/green deploy to minimize downtime.

10) Monitoring, backup & incident response
Use Sentry for errors; PagerDuty for critical alerts.

Backup DB daily and keep weekly monthly snapshots with retention policy.

Run routine recovery drills (restore from backup in staging).

Keep an incident playbook: steps to rotate keys, revoke sessions, disable admin access.

11) Choice of stack (recommended given your background)
If you prefer PHP/Laravel (you said you used Laravel before) — Laravel + Livewire for a fast admin UI, with:

Frontend: Blade + Livewire (or React/Next for richer UI)

DB: Postgres (or MySQL) + Redis

Storage: AWS S3 / MinIO

Search: ElasticSearch or MeiliSearch (for jobs)

Queue: Redis + Horizon

Authentication: Laravel Sanctum (for SPA) + TOTP package

ORM: Eloquent with prepared statements (safe)

If you want JS stack: NestJS (backend) + Next.js (Admin) + TypeORM + Postgres.

12) Minimal roadmap / milestones
MVP (2–3 weeks): Auth, Jobs CRUD, Pages CRUD, Media uploads (S3), Dashboard, RBAC.

Phase 2 (2–4 weeks): Events, Applications, Consultation bookings, scheduled publishing, theme editor.

Phase 3 (2–3 weeks): Advanced security, image optimization, presigned URLs, monitoring & backups, tests.

Phase 4 (ongoing): Pen testing, performance tuning, multilingual, analytics dashboards, integrations.

13) Example "secure presigned URL" pattern (concept)
Admin requests POST /api/admin/media/presign-upload with filename & content-type.

Server validates admin permission and returns { url: "<S3 presigned upload URL>", id: "<media-id>", preview: "<signed CDN url>" }.

Client uploads directly to S3 with the presigned URL.

After success, client calls POST /api/admin/media/complete to mark file as ready. Server validates signature & creates DB record.

For downloads of CVs: generate presigned GET url that expires in e.g. 10 minutes.

14) Final notes & next steps I suggest
Choose stack (Laravel recommended since you're familiar). I can produce a starter repo structure and sample controller + migration if you want.

Decide hosting (VPS vs cloud managed). For scale and security, go cloud (AWS/GCP/Hetzner + Cloudflare).

Prioritize: 2FA + presigned uploads + audit logs + backups — these should be in MVP for production security.

If you want, I can now:

generate a detailed Laravel project scaffolding (folders, models, migrations, sample controllers + API routes) tailored to this spec, or

produce a React/Next admin UI mock (single-file component + Tailwind + theme editor UI), or

write the DB migrations and JobsController + ApplicationsController boilerplate code.

Which of those would you like next?

Copy-paste master prompt for your personal AI.

1 — MongoDB architecture & rationale (advanced, secure)
Overall design goals

Use MongoDB as primary document DB for all site data: pages, jobs, applications, events, consultations, media metadata, users/roles, settings, audit logs.

Use a combination of replica set for HA + optional sharding if very large scale (jobs & applications can scale).

Use TLS everywhere and enforce authentication; prefer managed service (MongoDB Atlas) or self-hosted with TLS + private network.

Enable encryption at rest (via provider or filesystem LVM encryption) and use Client-Side Field Level Encryption (FLE) for highly sensitive fields (passport numbers, CVs link tokens, personal identifiers).

Use change streams for real-time admin dashboards & notifications.

Suggested deployment

MongoDB Replica Set (3 nodes) for production + arbiter if needed.

For small/medium scale: MongoDB Atlas (recommended) — provides backups, encryption, monitoring.

Add a shared backup solution (snapshots + point-in-time backups).

Use a separate DB for admin telemetry/analytics (optional read-replicas).

2 — Collections, schemas & field validation (JSON Schema rules)
Below are recommended collections and example JSON-like schemas. Use MongoDB server-side validation (JSON Schema) to prevent bad documents.

users

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "email": "string (unique, indexed)",
  "name": "string",
  "phone": "string",
  "password_hash": "string",
  "roles": ["superadmin","content_admin","hr","event_mgr"],
  "mfa": { "type":"totp", "secret_encrypted": "bytes" },    // use FLE for secret
  "is_active": true,
  "created_at": "ISODate",
  "last_login": "ISODate"
}
Indexes:

unique index on email

TTL index for password_reset_tokens collection if separate

compound index on roles, is_active for admin queries

pages

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "slug": "string (unique)",
  "title": "string",
  "body": "html/markdown",
  "blocks": [ { "type":"hero", "props": { ... } } ],
  "seo": { "meta_title":"", "meta_description":"" },
  "status": "draft|published|archived",
  "author_id": ObjectId,
  "versions": [ { "version_id": ObjectId, "created_at": ISODate, "diff":"..." } ],
  "published_at": ISODate
}
Indexes: unique on slug, text index on title and body

jobs

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "title": "string",
  "company": { "name":"", "logo_media_id": ObjectId, "verified": true },
  "country": "string",
  "city": "string",
  "type": "full-time|part-time|contract",
  "salary": { "min": Number, "max": Number, "currency":"USD|NPR" },
  "description": "html",
  "requirements": ["string"],
  "benefits": ["string"],
  "posted_by": ObjectId,
  "status": "active|closed|draft",
  "featured": boolean,
  "views": Number,
  "created_at": ISODate
}
Indexes:

compound index {country:1, type:1, status:1, featured:-1} for fast filtering

TTL index if temp jobs

applications

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "job_id": ObjectId,
  "candidate": { "name":"", "email":"", "phone":"" },
  "resume_media_id": ObjectId,    // private file stored with encryption; media collection stores metadata
  "cover_letter": "string",
  "status": "applied|screening|interview|offered|rejected",
  "notes": [ { "by": ObjectId, "text": "", "created_at": ISODate } ],
  "applied_at": ISODate
}
Indexes: { job_id:1, status:1 } compound; text index on candidate name/email for search

events, consultations, media, settings, audit_logs

events: include capacity, tickets, RSVPs list of user ids or separate event_registrations

media: store path, mime, width, height, hash, sensitive: boolean, storage_backend, created_by, created_at. Use GridFS only for very large files >16MB; otherwise store in S3 and metadata in media.

settings : key-value with versioning

audit_logs: append-only documents with user_id, action, target, changes, ip, created_at. Consider writing to an immutable collection or external log store (ELK).

Validation: define JSON Schema rules in MongoDB collection validators to enforce types and required fields.

3 — Indexing & performance
Text indexes for search (jobs title, company, description).

Compound indexes for common filters (country + job_type + featured).

TTL indexes for sessions and temporary tokens.

Use hashed/shard keys if sharding (hash of job_id or user id).

Monitor index usage and avoid over-indexing.

Use covered queries where possible (project only necessary fields).

4 — Security (MongoDB specific + app-level)
MongoDB-level

Enforce TLS (--tlsMode requireTLS) between client & server.

Use SCRAM-SHA-256 or x.509 certificates for authentication.

IP allowlist in the network layer (Atlas allows IP whitelist).

Create least-privilege DB users per role (app-user, backup-user, analytics-user).

Enable database auditing (who, what, when).

Use encrypted storage; if self-hosting enable LVM or filesystem encryption; Atlas provides encryption-at-rest.

Enable Client-Side Field Level Encryption (FLE) for fields like mfa.secret, candidate.passport_number, or any PII. FLE keeps the encryption keys in a KMS (AWS KMS, GCP, or local vault).

Don’t store plaintext passwords — only hashed (Argon2 recommended), but these are saved in app, not DB encryption.

Application-level

Store sensitive files (resumes) in S3/MinIO and keep only metadata in Mongo; use presigned URLs that expire.

For extremely sensitive fields, store encrypted blob in Mongo using app-side encryption with keys from Vault.

Sanitize inputs, validate at server and DB levels.

Use rate limiting / WAF and IP throttling.

Regular vulnerability scanning on Mongo client libs and dependencies.

5 — Python + MongoDB integration recommendations
Drivers / Libraries

Use motor for async FastAPI/Starlette apps (recommended for high throughput).

Use pymongo for sync workloads.

Optionally use an ODM: ODMantic (async + Pydantic) or MongoEngine for sync.

For Field-Level Encryption with Python, use the MongoDB Client-Side FLE support via pymongo with KMS configured.

Example secure connection (async with motor) — minimal pattern

python
Copy
Edit
# pip install motor pymongo dnspython
import motor.motor_asyncio
from pymongo import ReadPreference

MONGO_URI = "mongodb+srv://app_user:APP_PASS@cluster0.mongodb.net/udaan?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

client = motor.motor_asyncio.AsyncIOMotorClient(
    MONGO_URI,
    tls=True,
    tlsCAFile="/path/to/ca.pem",   # if self-hosted use proper CA
    serverSelectionTimeoutMS=5000,
    maxPoolSize=50,
)

db = client.udaan

# sample usage
async def get_job(job_id):
    return await db.jobs.find_one({"_id": job_id})
Using ODMantic (example job model)

python
Copy
Edit
from odmantic import Model, Field
from typing import List, Optional
from datetime import datetime

class Company(Model):
    name: str
    logo_media_id: Optional[str]

class Job(Model):
    title: str
    company: Company
    country: str
    city: str
    job_type: str
    salary_min: Optional[int]
    salary_max: Optional[int]
    description: str
    requirements: List[str] = []
    status: str = "draft"
    featured: bool = False
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
FLE (client-side field-level encryption) — requires KMS key & driver support. Use for MFA secrets and passport numbers.

6 — Backups, monitoring & ops
Daily snapshots + point-in-time recovery, test restores monthly.

Enable monitoring (MongoDB Cloud/Atlas metrics) and integrate with Grafana/Prometheus.

Keep oplog retention for replica sets to support point-in-time restore and change stream windows.

Logging: stream slow query logs and audit logs to an external store (ELK or Cloud logging).

Automate index builds in maintenance windows.

7 — Handling resumes & CV files (sensitive files)
Store CVs in object storage (S3/MinIO) encrypted server-side.

Save only media metadata in Mongo (media_id, path, hash, sensitive:true).

Generate presigned GET URLs that expire in 5–15 minutes for admin download.

Alternatively, store a short-lived one-time token in Mongo that maps to the S3 path and validate token server-side before issuing presigned URL.

Scan uploaded files with antivirus (ClamAV or Cloud malware scanner).

8 — Fixes for responsive layout problems (deep explanation & step-by-step)
You said: “some designs go outside the frame, scroll up button goes outside, location parts go outside the frame.” Here’s how to systematically fix that.

Root causes

Missing meta viewport tag.

Fixed-width elements (px) or absolute positioning that doesn’t adapt.

Overflowing images or unwrapped long strings.

position: fixed elements without proper container or viewport constraints.

CSS transform / translate() pushing elements out of viewport.

Lack of box-sizing:border-box, inconsistent padding/margins.

No responsive breakpoints or improper use of width instead of max-width.

Immediate fixes (apply in CSS and markup)

Ensure correct viewport meta:

html
Copy
Edit
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover" />
Global reset:

css
Copy
Edit
* { box-sizing: border-box; }
html,body { height:100%; margin:0; padding:0; }
img, video { max-width: 100%; height: auto; display:block; }
Prevent horizontal overflow:

css
Copy
Edit
html, body { overflow-x: hidden; } /* temporary; fix underlying cause too */
Use flexible containers:

css
Copy
Edit
.container { width:100%; max-width:1200px; margin:0 auto; padding: 0 1rem; }
.row { display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap: 1rem; }
.col { flex: 1 1 250px; min-width: 220px; } /* responsive columns */
Fix long-strings or addresses:

css
Copy
Edit
.address, .job-title { overflow-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word; }
Scroll-to-top button inside viewport:

css
Copy
Edit
.scroll-top {
  position: fixed;
  right: 1rem; bottom: 1.25rem; z-index: 9999;
  width: 48px; height:48px; border-radius: 999px;
  display: flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center;
  touch-action: manipulation;
}
@media (max-width:480px){
  .scroll-top { right: 0.5rem; bottom: 0.85rem; width:44px; height:44px; }
}
Make sure it’s not positioned using vw offsets which can push beyond safe area. For iOS safe area use env(safe-area-inset-bottom).

Use clamp() for font sizes so they scale gracefully:

css
Copy
Edit
h1 { font-size: clamp(1.4rem, 2.5vw, 2.25rem); }
Fix off-canvas content (e.g., location map) by using responsive embeds:

css
Copy
Edit
.embed-responsive { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow:hidden; }
.embed-responsive iframe { position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:0; }
Test and fix each section: on devtools toggle device toolbar and inspect each component; add media query tweaks for widths where layout breaks.

Performance/smoothness improvements

Avoid layout thrashing: batch DOM reads & writes; use transform: translate and opacity for animations instead of top/left.

Use will-change: transform sparingly on elements that animate.

Use requestAnimationFrame for JS-driven animations and IntersectionObserver for lazy loading images.

Use hardware accelerated CSS (translate3d/transform) for parallax.

Limit heavy CSS selectors, reduce repaints.

Defer non-critical JS and fonts; preload key assets.

Testing process

Add responsive regression tests: use Playwright/Cypress to snapshot pages at common breakpoints (320, 375, 425, 768, 1024, 1366).

QA checklist for each page: home, jobs list, job details, events, contact, consultation — ensure no horizontal scroll and key CTAs are visible.

9 — Admin panel design & theme (practical guidance)
Design & UX principles

Clean, minimal, mobile-first admin UI.

Use component library (Tailwind + shadcn/ui or Radix + Tailwind) for consistent patterns.

Top-level layout: left vertical nav (collapsible), top bar with search & user menu, content area.

Provide dark & light theme toggle; theme editor to change primary/secondary colors & fonts (store values in settings.theme in DB).

Responsive Admin: nav collapses to hamburger on mobile; critical actions must be reachable.

Admin features (UX)

Dashboard widgets with KPIs and change-stream live updates.

Quick-create floating action button (FAB) for new Job / Event / Page.

WYSIWYG editor (TipTap / ProseMirror) with custom blocks and SEO sidebar.

Media Manager with drag & drop + image edit modal.

Role-based UI: hide or disable buttons if permission missing.

Inline content preview & staging (Preview button opens a signed preview URL).

Theme editor UI

Color pickers for primary/secondary/background/text; export CSS variables.

Font selector: Google Fonts + custom upload; use @font-face for uploaded woff2.

Save theme with versioning and “apply to production” action.

Live preview frame showing homepage with theme applied.

Admin security UX

2FA setup page with QR + backup codes.

Active sessions page with remote revoke.

Threat center: show blocked IPs + recent failed logins.

10 — Tasks for today (practical, prioritized)
Goal: deliver measurable progress on three priorities: responsive fixes, admin panel skeleton, DB connectivity.

Responsive fixes (priority 1) — (deliverable: fixed CSS + test report)

Add viewport meta and global CSS reset.

Fix .container rules and ensure max-width & padding applied everywhere.

Fix images: apply max-width:100% to all images and set object-fit:cover where needed.

Update scroll-to-top CSS to keep the button inside safe area (use env(safe-area-inset-bottom)).

Fix overflowing address/location text (word-break, overflow-wrap).

Run responsive snapshots (mobile breakpoints: 360, 412, 768) and produce a list of sections still failing.

Admin Panel (priority 2) — (deliverable: skeleton UI + auth flow)

Scaffold Admin app (Next.js/React or Laravel+Livewire per your stack).

Implement login + 2FA (TOTP) flow and role-based routing guard.

Build main layout (left nav, top bar, content area).

Create placeholder pages: Dashboard, Jobs, Pages, Media, Users, Settings.

Implement theme toggles & preview stub.

Database connectivity (priority 3) — (deliverable: secure connection + test endpoints)

Provision MongoDB (Atlas recommended) or configure self-hosted with TLS.

Create DB user app_user with least privileges.

Implement Python connection module using motor with TLS & connection pooling.

Implement quick API endpoints to test CRUD for Jobs and Pages (GET/POST), and verify indexes exist.

Log DB connection health endpoint /admin/health/db.

Extras (if time allows):

Implement presigned upload flow for media (endpoint to create presigned upload URL).

Create audit log write on user login and admin actions.

BUILD: Udaan Agencies — Secure MongoDB backend + responsive frontend + Admin Panel

Objective:
Build a production-ready system for Udaan Agencies: responsive public site and a secure Admin Panel that manages pages, jobs, events, consultations, users, media, and settings. Use MongoDB as the database and Python for backend services. The Admin Panel must be responsive, role-based, secure, and support CRUD across all client-facing content. Use best practices for performance, security, backups, and deployment.

Deliverables:
1. MongoDB database design (collections, JSON Schema validators, indexes) and server deployment plan (replica set, backups, TLS, KMS).
2. Python backend (FastAPI or Django) with async Motor or PyMongo integration, implementing Auth (JWT + refresh + TOTP MFA), CRUD endpoints for Jobs/Pages/Events/Applications, presigned upload flow for media, and audit logging.
3. Admin Panel (React/Next.js or Laravel+Livewire) with:
   - Layout: collapsible left nav, top bar, content area.
   - Pages: Dashboard, Pages (WYSIWYG & versioning), Jobs (bulk import/export), Applications, Events, Consultations, Media Manager, Users/Roles, Theme Editor, Settings, Audit Logs.
   - Responsive mobile-first design, theme toggles, and live preview.
4. Responsive fixes: fully resolve overflow issues (elements going outside the frame), fix scroll-to-top button, ensure map/location & long text wrap properly. Provide CSS & JS fixes.
5. Security: TLS, DB auth (SCRAM/x.509), Client-side Field Level Encryption for PII, presigned URLs for storage, rate limiting, CSP, CORS, CSRF protection, WAF recommendations, backup & key rotation plan.
6. CI/CD pipeline, automated tests (unit + integration + e2e), monitoring (Sentry + metrics), and runbook for DB restore and incident response.

Priority TASKS for TODAY (complete & commit changes):
A. Responsive & Smoothness
  - Add meta viewport and global CSS reset.
  - Fix container, grid and column CSS so no component overflows on mobile.
  - Ensure images and embeds use responsive wrappers.
  - Fix scroll-to-top: keep inside safe viewport for mobile (use env(safe-area-inset-*)).
  - Implement `overflow-wrap` for addresses/long text and test on breakpoints 320/375/412/768.
  - Add small performance improvements: lazy load images (loading="lazy"), IntersectionObserver for images, minimize layout thrash in animations (use transform + will-change).

B. Admin Panel skeleton
  - Scaffold Admin UI and implement login + TOTP 2FA.
  - Implement role-based routing & permission checks (superadmin, content_admin, hr, event_mgr).
  - Create pages: Dashboard, Jobs (CRUD), Pages (CRUD), Media (presigned upload endpoint exist), Users, Settings.
  - Implement theme editor stub that writes theme variables to `settings.theme`.

C. DB connectivity & security
  - Provision MongoDB instance (Atlas or self-hosted with TLS).
  - Create `app_user` DB role with least privilege and add connection in backend `.env`.
  - Implement secure connection module using Motor including a `/admin/health/db` endpoint.
  - Create collection validators for `users`, `jobs`, `pages`, `applications`, and `media`.
  - Create recommended indexes (text, compound, TTL for sessions).

Quality criteria:
- No horizontal overflow anywhere on all primary pages at standard breakpoints.
- Admin must authenticate + TOTP to access admin routes.
- Media upload uses presigned URL flow; resumes are stored encrypted and accessible via time-limited presigned URL.
- Audit logs recorded for create/update/delete in append-only manner.

Tech preferences:
- Backend: Python (FastAPI recommended) + Motor; optionally Django with Djongo if preferred.
- Admin UI: React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS and shadcn components (or Laravel Livewire if using Laravel).
- Database: MongoDB Replica Set (Atlas preferred).
- Storage: S3-compatible (MinIO or AWS S3).
- CI: GitHub Actions; Testing: pytest + Playwright.

Include in your commit:
- README with run instructions, env sample, and how to test responsive fixes.
- Postman/Insomnia collection or OpenAPI YAML for API testing.
- Automated tests for at least: login+2FA, job create/read, upload presign, and a responsive snapshot test.

Timebox:
- Complete the "Today" tasks and provide a short report + failing sections list by end of day.

Start now and produce a PR with:
- CSS fixes for responsive issues and a checklist of sections fixed.
- Admin skeleton with auth and DB connectivity tests.
- DB validators and index creation scripts.

Final quick recommendations & next step
If you want, I can now: (pick one)

Generate the exact MongoDB JSON Schema validators for the collections above.

Produce Python motor connection module + example CRUD endpoints for Jobs and Pages.

Produce the CSS patch (a single CSS file) to immediately fix overflow and scroll-to-top issues.

Got it — you want me to write you one complete, detailed prompt that you can give to your personal AI so it builds:

A fully responsive, smooth UI (fixing all “out-of-frame” issues, scroll button placement, mobile optimization)

A secure, non-hackable, attractive admin panel

A Python-based MVC project

Using MongoDB (with best practices for advanced database security)

With job vacancy application features (user submits name, number, email, etc., stored in DB, visible in real-time in the admin panel, editable/deletable)

With extra form sections for other purposes

Following modern libraries & secure coding principles

Here’s your ready-to-use prompt ⬇️

Prompt:

Build me a Python-based MVC web application using Flask (or Django if more scalable) and MongoDB as the primary database. The MongoDB integration should use MongoEngine or PyMongo with full security hardening:

Enable TLS/SSL connections to MongoDB.

Enforce authentication for DB access.

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict admin actions.

Use input validation & sanitization to prevent NoSQL injection.

Store credentials securely in environment variables.

Enable IP whitelisting for the DB server.

Frontend Requirements:

The entire website must be fully responsive with smooth animations and transitions.

No UI element should overflow or go out of frame on any screen size (mobile, tablet, desktop).

The scroll-to-top button must stay fixed at the correct position on all devices.

All location-related elements and sections must resize and adapt correctly to viewport changes.

Use Bootstrap 5 or Tailwind CSS for responsive grids and utility classes.

Add subtle hover effects, smooth scrolling, and loading animations for an elegant feel.

Job Vacancy Application Feature:

Public users can view posted vacancies (e.g., jobs in Dubai, etc.).

Users can apply by filling out a form (name, number, email, and other fields).

Submissions are stored in MongoDB in real time.

Data instantly appears in the admin panel without a page reload (using WebSockets or AJAX polling).

Admin Panel Requirements:

Non-hackable, secure login with password hashing (bcrypt/argon2) and session protection.

Attractive dashboard UI (use AdminLTE, Tabler, or custom Tailwind UI components).

Ability to view, edit, delete job applications.

Ability to post/edit/remove job vacancies.

Implement search and filter functionality for applications.

Protect all routes with authentication middleware.

Log all admin actions (for security auditing).

Architecture & Tech Stack:

Python 3.10+

Flask or Django (MVC structure)

MongoDB + MongoEngine/PyMongo

Bootstrap 5 or Tailwind CSS

AdminLTE 3 or custom responsive admin UI

Flask-SocketIO or Django Channels for real-time updates

bcrypt/argon2 for password hashing

WTForms or Django Forms for validation

Extra Security Features:

CSRF protection

XSS filtering

Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

HTTPS enforcement

Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

Deliver the full source code with:

A /static and /templates folder structure for MVC.

A .env.example file for configuration.

A requirements.txt file with dependencies.

Clear documentation on how to run the project locally and in production.

If you give this to your AI, it will have everything it needs to build a responsive, secure, real-time job vacancy portal with a robust admin panel.

I can also write you a ready-made database schema + MVC folder structure so your AI builds it with zero guesswork. Would you like me to prepare that?
